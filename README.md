# Spammer
A minimalist spammer that is light on resources and memory
To use it, first download a Python IDE. 
This code requires a package. To install it, go to your Command Prompt/Terminal and type in pip install pyautogui
After that, use your IDE to compile and run the code. You have 5 seconds to open the app that you want to spam in, and wherever there is an option of typing, the program will spam 
in it.
